# Features to Implement:
Notice that our coding elements would contains:  
```
1. Generation of random game sets or events  
2. Data structures for storing game status  
3. Dynamic memory management  
4. File input/output (e.g., for loading/saving game status)  
5. Program codes in multiple files
```
Using the above coding elements, We would therefore implement following features:  
***1. to be continued***  
```

```
***2. to be continued***
```

```
***3. tbc***
```

```
