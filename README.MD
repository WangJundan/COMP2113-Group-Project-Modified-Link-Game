# Description of the Game:
  ### Brief Introduction:
    haha
  
  
  ### Game Rules:
     * The user-interfece would provide the player with a super-remove botton, 2 location coordinates input windows and a picture with random figures distribution.  
     * The player need to find out all the connectable figures by pairs. When finding out a pair and input their locations via the windows, they would disappear automaticlly. When all figures disappear, the player wins.  
     * As for so-called "connectable", it refers to: whenever horizonal or vertical, the connecting line can only have at most 3 straight segment.  
     * super-remove button: randomly eliminate one connectable pair regardless the limitation of the above rules.
     

# Features to Implement:
Notice that our coding elements would contains:  
```
1. Generation of random game sets or events  
2. Data structures for storing game status  
3. Dynamic memory management  
4. File input/output (e.g., for loading/saving game status)  
5. Program codes in multiple files
```
Using the above coding elements, We would therefore implement following features:  
***1. to be continued***  
```

```
***2. to be continued***
```

```
***3. tbc***
```

```
